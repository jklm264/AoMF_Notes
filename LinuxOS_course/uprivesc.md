# User Privilege Escalation

sudo

**Some distros will add remote host attempting to login with root to hosts.deny**

sudoers file:

- `/etc/sudoers`; edit with `#visudo`

- limit sudo ability by user or host
- because sudo privilege is given out, keeps real root password secure 

logs found in auth.log



[BONUS] sudoedit - allows a user to edit a file as another user.
